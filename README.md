FINAL GROUP PROJECT 3
Daniela Macias & Maria Barroeta
This project aims to sort Amazon reviews through merge and quick sorting algorithms and comparing the time that it takes both to execute. 
For more information on the data files used, please refer to the README.md located in the "data" folder. 

How to fork this repository:
1) Open this website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews?resource=download
   - This is the website we used to obtain the dataset for our project.
3) Scroll down and download the zip file titled "amazon_review_polarity_csv.tgz".
4) Sign up for the website if it prompts you to (Make sure to uncheck the box that asks if you want email from this website).

5) Now, clone this repository.
   - If you are using CLion (which is what we used)
     1) On GitHub, click "Use this template" on the upper right hand corner.
     2) Click "Create a new repository".
     3) Name it whatever you want (but nothing crazy!), click private or public (up to you!), and finally "Create Repository".
     4) Now on your own Cloned Repository, click on the green "Code" button. Copy the URL that you see there.
     5) Now open CLion and click "Get from VCS".
     6) Paste the URL that you copied from Github.
     7) Click "Clone" and "Ok".
     8) Yay you made a clone! But you are not done muahahahah
6) Now lets go back to the zip file from earlier. Open it, and copy the files titled "test.csv" and "train.csv" into the data folder.
   - This can either be done in your Finder/File Explorer where you can simply copy and paste these files into the data folder of your newly created Project3 clone
     OR
   - Simply copy them straight into the data folder in CLion
  
7) On your CMakeLists.txt file, change the name that is inside the set_target_properties from Project3 to whatever you chose to name your repository earlier.
8) Now this project is ready for all kinds of fun testing!!
